	* evalprocs.[ch]: new file: contains a "eval" procedure

1999-03-11  Linus Åkerlund  <uxm165t@tninet.se>

	* eval.c: added a check for NULL args, so that you won't get
	coredumps when passing undefined symbols as arguments to
	procedures or special forms, unless where appropriate.

1999-03-10  Linus Åkerlund  <uxm165t@tninet.se>

	* typepredicates.c: added char?.

	* number.c, list.c: added typechecks to lisp procedures, which
	should reduce the number of coredumps.

	* convert.c: added char->integer, integer->char, string->list and
	list->string.

	* chars.c, chars.h (new files): added the following procedures:
	char=?, char>?, char<?, char>=?, char<=?, char-ci=?, char-ci>?,
	char-ci<?, char-ci>=?, char-ci<=?, char-alphabetic?,
	char-numeric?, char-whitespace?, char-upper? and char-lower?.

	* read.c: added char support.

1999-03-09  Linus Åkerlund  <uxm165t@tninet.se>

	* read.c and load.c: Rewrote large parts to make
	lipa_read_general() and _l_read* take a string as argument.

	* convert.c: added number->string, string->symbol, symbol->string.
	(from lipa-patch-0.0.9-l3)

	* basic.h: added NUMBERP and L_NUMBER

	* read.c: skip comments

	* list.c: added lipa_cadr, lipa_caddr since I wanted them, should
	make the list more complete

	* basic.[ch]: New type, L_OBJ_USEROBJECT

Mon Mar  8 01:08:21 1999  Simon Kågedal  <sika8225@csd.uu.se>

	* *.[ch]: libifying, major renaming all over the place

1999-03-07  Simon Kågedal  <sika8225@csd.uu.se>

	* moved files to lib/ and renamed some:

	lispparser.[ch]		=> basic.[ch]
	lipaconvert.[ch]	=> convert.[ch]
	lipaint.[ch]		=> numbers.[ch]
	lipastring.[ch]		=> strings.[ch]

	* read.c: 8-bit cleanness: use guchar instead of gchar

1999-03-05  Linus Åkerlund  <uxm165t@tninet.se>

	* lipaconvert.c: added  this file and string->number.

	* lipastring.c: added substring procedure.

	* Added string>?, string<? etc.

1999-03-04  Simon Kagedal  <sika8225@csd.uu.se>

	* lispparser.c (symbol_complete): tab completion for symbols

	* load.c: thought loading needed a file of it's own, since it is
	not only reading but also evaluating.  loading now works.
	
	* print.c, print.h: split off from lispparser.[ch]

	* lipaint.c (mod): fixed a bug

1999-03-04  Linus Åkerlund  <uxm165t@tninet.se>

	* Added predicates string=? and string-ci=?.

	* Added string-length procedure.

	* Added predicates zero?, positive?, negative?, odd? and even?.
	
1999-03-03  Linus Åkerlund  <uxm165t@tninet.se>

	* Fixed < and > to take x > 1 number of arguments.  Added >= and
	<=. 

1999-03-01  Linus Åkerlund  <uxm165t@tninet.se>

	* Changed the names of some procedures to make lipa a bit more
	r5rs compliant.

	* Added some more simple mathematical functions; min, max, abs,
	gcd, floor, ceiling, truncate, round and sqrt.

	* Added the predicates boolean? and number?.

1999-03-01  Simon K}gedal  <sika8225@csd.uu.se>

	* Included string patches ('\n', '\t' and friends)

	* lipastring.c: New function ``display''

1999-02-27  Linus Åkerlund  <uxm165t@tninet.se>

	* Added support for floats.

1999-02-26  Simon Kågedal  <sika8225@csd.uu.se>

	* Released 0.0.6.  Thought of renaming it to "lithp".

	* lipaint.c (divide): Integrated division by zero patch from Linus
	Åkerlund <uxm165t@tninet.se>

1999-02-26  Simon Kagedal  <sika8225@csd.uu.se>

	* Released 0.0.5, bumped up version to 0.0.6.

	* typepredicates.c: New file with some type predicates for use in
	  Lisp

	* lispparser.h: Reworked LObject.  Removed LSymbol, LFunction
	  and those, have a big union in LObject instead.
	  Added a bunch of type predicates for use in C.

	* gonna do some restructuring, so "released" 0.0.4

1999-02-24  Simon Kagedal  <sika8225@csd.uu.se>

	* read.c: tried fixing up reading stuff... blah...

1999-02-21  Simon Kagedal  <sika8225@csd.uu.se>

	* lipalist.c, lipalist.h: cons and car and realizing the current
	list handling is very wrong, see TODO

	* list.c, list.h: some GSList helper functions

	* lipaint.c: comparison functions

	* lispparser.c: "if" special form

1999-02-20  Simon Kagedal  <sika8225@csd.uu.se>

	* lipaint.c, lipaint.h: Some simple int arithmetic functions

	* lipastring.c, lipastring.h: An "append" function

	* lispparser.c: Whoo!  It can do some stuff!
