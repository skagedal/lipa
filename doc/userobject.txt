	User-defined objects
	simon 1999-03-09

I added a hack so the user (C programmer) can let their subr's return
objects of their own type.  For now, it's pretty lame and should be
done in another way.

Today, you can do lipa_new_userobject (some_data).

You can't really make more than one type.

There should be some way to register types, along with a name of the
type (for the print representation), maybe callbacks for eval etc.?,
and to easily do typecheck predicates etc.
