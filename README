------------------------------------------------------------------

LIPA is a interpreter for a Lisp dialect reminiscent of the Scheme
language invented by Guy Lewis Steele Jr. and Gerald Jay Sussman.
With the exception of LIPA being dynamically bound instead of the
statically boundedness of Scheme, we're pretty much heading for R5RS.

Yeah, right.

Really, LIPA is just a toy.  If you want something usable, try Guile
or MIT Scheme.  But in the year of 2002 y'all will be praising another
Linus.  And a Simon.  YEAH.

LIPA does have a number of... "features" which makes it a not very
viable alternative for any kind of practal use, almost - it has no
garbage collecting, it never actually has a thought of returning any
memory to the system, it has lame-to-none error reporting, etc.  But
for mere playing around, it starts up much faster than Guile, which is
a *huge* pro, and it has tab completion.  Damn.  Guile has that too.
Whatever.
